# KNN-Algorithm
Algorithm that takes in a CSV and analyses it with KNN


The beggining of the program has a little snippet which reads a comma seperated value(CSV) file. It converts all the given data from strings to integers and then splits the data into a certain number of folds(up to your discretion). Towards the end of the file is code that will evaluate the effectiveness of the model with the given data. To utilize this, change the "INSERT-FILE-NAME-HERE" in line 125 to the file of your choice.
